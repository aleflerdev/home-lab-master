## How to Create a Web Design Style Guide

Here are the steps you need to take to create a web design style guide for yourself:

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with the Brand

Whether you’re creating a style guide for your own website or for someone else, the same principle still applies: you need take time to assess what the brand is about. This means, understanding your target audience, knowing the values of the company, and have a solid idea of how this should be represented visually. If the company has done A/B testing for certain designs in the past, now is the time to leverage that info to create a more robust and more effective style guide.

### 2. Choose Colors

As you evaluate the brand, you’ll need to think of colors. If the company already has a palette they work with — perfect. Add the hex codes for the colors in the style guide. Be sure to break this information down into categories for text, links, hover links, backgrounds, buttons, etc. Make it clear what colors should be used where.

### 3. Select and Identify Typography

Along with colors you need to make it plain what fonts should be used (and where they should be used). Within your web design style guide, clearly identify the font names, sizes, and line height. This makes it super easy for future designers to recreate the appropriate look of your site. Better yet, create a Photoshop template that has these elements established as presets or identified as a note within the file itself.

Your every effort should be to eliminate the guesswork here.

### 4. Establish a Content Grid

Another thing you should add to your web design style guide is to create a [content grid](https://uxdesign.cc/all-you-need-to-know-about-style-guide-9513ebf50b46). This is the perfect way to identify how pages and blog posts should be laid out. Showcase where pictures and graphics should be positioned among the text. You really need this for understanding how your content should be spaced out.

Now, some of this can be taken care of by blog and page templates. Even so, it’s still a good idea to include that information in your style guide.

### 5. Set Photo Specifications

Another thing you can do is set photo specifications. Many websites will apply filters or effects on images they include in blog posts, for instance. So, if you want to ensure whoever is managing your site’s content knows how to keep everything looking consistent, you need to call out these specifics in your web design style guide.

Identify the specs each image should follow, including image height, width, color filters, opacity, and whether or not text should be added. Should you wish to include text on your graphics, be sure to call out the font, style, size, and color specs (as noted above) as well.

### 6. Logo Specifications

The last thing we’re discussing here that your guide absolutely must include is information about logos. A logo is perhaps the most identifiable part of your brand and website, which makes it super important to discuss here.

Logo specifications require including the [minimum sizes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/designing-style-guidelines-for-brands-and-websites/) as well as a variety of different logo styles. You should have a text option as well as a graphical one for small spaces. A logo with a tagline might be a good idea too for larger size options.

You should also provide logos with different backgrounds, including transparent. This way, your logo will look great no matter what background it’s sitting on. Each of these logo options should be included on the style guide page itself so they can be accessed and referenced quickly.
