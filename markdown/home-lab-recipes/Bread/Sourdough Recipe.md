### Ingredients
1 part - sd 200g
2 part - h2o 400g
3 part - flour 600g

#### First Proofing

* Mix ingredients together with either hands or spatula
* Let rest covered in the bowl for 30 mins and up to 1 hour

#### Knead dough ball

* After the resting period add the salt and a splash of water (super important)
* Get the dough out of bowl on clean non-porous surface
* Knead the dough for **at least 10 mins** (it should be nicely elastic and not sticky)

#### Second Proofing

* Let proof for 4 hours in a warm environment


#### After Second Proofing

* Put on non-floured countertop and put flour on it and flip it
* Get it moving and form into a nice ball
* Let rest covered 30 mins covered with Saran wrap

-----

#### Forming the ball

* Flatten slightly like a pancake and flip it, then sprinkle with flour
* Fold
  1. bottom to almost top
  2. left to almost right
  3. right to almost left
  4. top to bottom
  5. bottom to top
  6. and then roll it
  7. with seam of dough on the bottom use a flat knife to roll the dough around a little on the surface and you will begin to notice tension building up

----

#### Final Proofing

* Use a bowl big enough for the dough and cover the bowl with a kitchen towel
* Liberally add floor all over the kitchen towel
* Dust the dough ball as well and place upside down on the kitchen towel in the bowl (seam of the dough facing up)
* Cover and cool in the fridge over night

-----

Preparing for baking

* Remove dough from the fridge 2 hours before you want to bake
* Use a Dutch oven big enough for the finished dough size (guess?)
* Place the Dutch oven in your oven at 480&deg;F for approx. 30 mins
* Remove Dutch oven and place somewhere it won't burn your countertops and place the sourdough ball inside the Dutch oven being careful not to burn yourself
* Score the dough low down on the dough and on the top (a razor blade works very well for this)
* Spray the outside of dough a few times with water
* And place the Dutch oven with sourdough ball inside back into the oven
* Immediately turn the oven down to 430&deg;F and **do not** remove the lid for the first 25 mins
* After 25 mins take the lid off and bake for 25 mins or so

**Voila - Enjoy**
